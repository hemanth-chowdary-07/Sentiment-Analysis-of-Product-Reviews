Product Review Sentiment
Analysis
The goal of this project is to analyse customer reviews to determine their
sentiment (positive, negative or neutral) based on the text content of the
reviews and associated metadata. This will help in understanding customer
feedback, identifying product strengths and weaknesses and improving the
overall customer experience by offering actionable insights.



**Problem Statement**
E-commerce platforms like Amazon, Jumia, Konga, Ebay, Ali Express and other
online retailers in Nigeria and beyond collect millions of product reviews daily.
These reviews are rich sources of customer feedback but are often unstructured,
making manual analysis time-consuming and inefficient. Companies often need
to quickly interpret the sentiments expressed in these reviews to understand
how customers feel about their products, identify key pain points and adjust their
business strategies accordingly. However, sorting through vast amounts of text
data to understand customer sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) poses a
significant challenge. This project aims to automate the process of sentiment
analysis using machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP)
techniques. By automating sentiment detection, businesses can gain real-time
insights from reviews, leading to better decision-making, improved product
offerings and enhanced customer satisfaction.
